excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a protein crystallographer by training, having spent the last 18 years working in a range of research environments in Australia, Scotland, Sweden and England. My research has tended to ramble across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, and computational science. Historically I have enjoyed working on projects that were linked to environmental friendly and sustainability based outcomes, but one thing I have learnt over the years is that I love to work with data. I find enjoyment in diving in and pulling out some meaning or another. 

I am adept at data acquisition, management and analysis with >20 internationally relevant peer reviewed published **[articles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pMLL7IoAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I have considerable international experience having worked as a research scientist in Australia, Scotland, Sweden, and England; a string of employment success, indicative of a very capable scientist. 

Proven record of adaptability, and fast learning. Eager to compliment existing skills and transitioning into data science. Highly motivated and keen to make an impact.
