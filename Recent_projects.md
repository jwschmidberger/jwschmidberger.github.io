## edX Data Science Professional Certificate
I have recently concluded an online course in Data Science through the **[edX](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard)**. The **[course](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/3c32e3e0-b6fe-4ee4-bd4f-210c6339e074/)**, is broken up into nine modules covering diverse aspects of data science, from data wrangling to machine learning, through the use of R. 

The final Capstone module involved two machine learning projects that were designed to showcase the skills developed throughout the course. 

### Project 1: MovieLens Recommender System
This project centered on a modified version of the **[MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)** database and in it I created a recommender system through a range of methods, each building on eachother to result in a model that had an RMSE of 0.8602. A pdf report of my work can be found **[here](/pdfs/200328_Capstone_sub.pdf)**. To see the Rmd file click **[here](/pdfs/200328_Capstone_sub.Rmd)**. Techniques used: Data regularisation, Principle Component Analysis

### Project 2: Credit Card Fraud
In the second project we were free to choose what ever dataset we wished. I chose a dataset that dealt with credit card fraud in Europe in 2013 as I get a particular satisfaction from the idea of catching fraudsters. The dataset I chose turned out to be far from trivial as it was good example of highly imbalanced data with respect to the response variable. My **[report](/pdfs/200529_creditcard3.pdf)** highlights a kind of journey of discovery, effectivly showcasing my problem solving methodology rather than just reporting a final polished model. You can also get the Rmd file for the project **[here](/pdfs/200529_creditcard3.Rmd)**. Techinques used: Regression analysis (linear and logistic), Random Forests (Rborist and RandomForest), data balancing (SMOTE).
