# edX Data Science Professional Certificate
I have recently concluded an online course in Data Science through the **[edX](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard)**. The **[course](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/3c32e3e0-b6fe-4ee4-bd4f-210c6339e074/)**, is broken up into nine modules covering diverse aspects of data science, from data wrangling to machine learning, through the use of R. 

The final Capstone module involved two machine learning projects that were designed to showcase the skills developed throughout the course. 

## Project 1: MovieLens Recommender System
This project centered on a modified version of the **[MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)** database and in it I created a recommender system through a range of methods, each building on eachother to result in a model that had an RMSE of 0.8602. A pdf report of my work can be found **[here](/pdfs/200328_Capstone_sub.pdf)**. To see the Rmd file click **[here](/Rmd_files/200328_Capstone_sub.Rmd)**.
